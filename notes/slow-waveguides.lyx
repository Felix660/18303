A ``waveguide'' is a structure that allows waves to propagate along one
 (or more) direction(s) while confining them in one or more other

transverse
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 directions.
 These arise in many forms in many different wave equations, with a variety
 of mechanisms for the transverse confinement: silica optical fibers, sound
 waves propagating down hollow tubes, coaxial transmission lines, and so
 forth.
 One commonplace confinement mechanism is known as

, where waves are trapped in a region (

) of higher refractive index (e.g.
 the core of an optical fiber) surrounded by a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

cladding
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 of a lower index.
 It turns out that this mechanism is not specific to optics, and the general
 principle is that waves can be trapped in a medium where the wave speed
 (phase velocity) is 
\emph on
slower

 than in the surrounding medium.
 Moreover, it turns out that we can

prove

 the existence of such localized solutions quite generally---even in cases
 that we cannot solve analytically---using a

 proof that is closely related to proofs of localization (

Review of scalar waves
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In these notes, we consider the scalar wave equation:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
-\hat{A}u=c^{2}\nabla^{2}u=\frac{\partial^{2}u}{\partial t^{2}},
\]

\end_inset

where the coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $c(\vec{x})>0$
\end_inset

, which has units of speed, is some function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{x}$
\end_inset

 and we have defined the linear operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}=-c^{2}\nabla^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 It is straightforward to show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 is Hermitian (i.e.
 self-adjoint, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}=\hat{A}^{*}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $*$
\end_inset

 denotes the adjoint) and positive semidefinite under a variety of boundary
 conditions on 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 or its normal derivative vanishes at the boundary of the domain) with the
 inner product 
\begin_inset Formula $\langle u,v\rangle=\int\frac{\bar{u}v}{c^{2}}$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{u}$
\end_inset

 denote complex conjugation), i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\langle u,\hat{A}v\rangle=\langle\hat{A}u,v\rangle$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\langle u,\hat{A}u\rangle=\int|\nabla u|^{2}\le0$
\end_inset

Or rather, for all 
\begin_inset Formula $u,v$

 that we restrict ourselves to functions where these integrals are defined.
 In these notes, I won't worry about pinning down the precise function spaces.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For finite-dimensional Hermitian operators, you always have a basis of eigenvect
ors (diagonalizability).
 For infinite-dimensional operators (i.e.
 operators on functions), one can construct pathological counterexamples
 where this is not the case, but these are rarely relevant to physical problems-
--the counterexamples typically exhibit solutions that oscillate infinitely
 fast as they approach some point.
 So, physicists typically assume that all Hermitian problems have a basis
 of eigenfunctions.
 A more rigorous approach can be found in any book on functional analysis,

\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 is often quite limited.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 i.e.
 a complete basis of eigenfunctions for 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

, and to understand the solution of the wave equation it is enough to understand
 the eigenfunctions

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In an infinite domain, functional analysts would call some of these solutions
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

generalized
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 eigenfunctions.
 e.g.
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $c=1$
\end_inset

 on an infinite domain, the solutions are planewaves 
\begin_inset Formula $u=e^{i\vec{k}\cdot\vec{x}}$
\end_inset

 for real vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{k}$
\end_inset

 (disallowing solutions that grow exponentially at infinity), but these
 are not normalizable: 
\begin_inset Formula $\langle u,u\rangle$
\end_inset

 diverges, and 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 lives in a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 I will gloss over this and similar distinctions.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $u(\vec{x})$
\end_inset

 satisfying 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}u=\lambda u$
\end_inset

.
 It is easy to show that the self-adjointness means that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 will be real, and the positive-semidefiniteness means that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\geq0$
\end_inset

, so it is convenient to write 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=\omega^{2}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 is real with units of frequency.
 Plugging this back into the wave equation, we see that 
\begin_inset Formula $-\hat{A}u=-\omega^{2}u=\ddot{u}$
\end_inset

 and hence each eigensolution describes oscillating modes 
\begin_inset Formula $u(\vec{x})e^{\pm i\omega t}$
\end_inset

 with (eigen)frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

.
 These are the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

normal modes:
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 another consequence of self-adjointness is that eigensolutions are 
\emph on
orthogonal
\emph default
: given 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}u_{1}=\omega_{1}^{2}u_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}u_{2}=\omega_{2}^{2}u_{2}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{1}^{2}\neq\omega_{2}^{2}$
\end_inset

, it is easy to show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\langle u_{1},u_{2}\rangle=0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 is a constant (homogeneous 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

), the eigensolutions yield the planewaves 
\begin_inset Formula $u(\vec{x},t)=e^{i(\vec{k}\cdot\vec{x}-\omega t)}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega(\vec{k})=\pm c|\vec{k}|$
\end_inset

, in which case 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 is the magnitude of both the phase velocity (
\begin_inset Formula $\omega/|\vec{k}|$
\end_inset

) and the group velocity (
\begin_inset Formula $|\nabla_{k}\omega|$
\end_inset

): it is the speed at which waves travel and information propagates.
 For the case of inhomogeneous 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 considered below, the solutions and hence the velocities are more complicated,
 but we can still in some sense think of smaller-
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 regions as being

\[
\hat{A}_{k}=e^{-ikz}\hat{A}e^{ikz}=c^{2}\left(-\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial x^{2}}+k^{2}\right).

 we have a 1d eigenproblem for the

\begin_inset Formula $u_{k}(x)$

 Note that

 is also self-adjoint positive semidefinite, like

 Hence, for

 the eigenfunctions

\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{1}\neq\omega_{2}$

\begin_inset Formula $\langle u_{k,1},u_{k,2}\rangle=0$

\begin_inset Formula $\langle u(x),v(x)\rangle=\int\frac{\bar{u}v}{c^{2}}dx$

\begin_layout Standard
Waveguide modes (also called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

guided
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bound
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 modes) are solutions for which 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{k}$
\end_inset

 is localized; at the very least so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\int|u_{k}|^{2}dx<\infty$
\end_inset

, and typically 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{k}(x)$
\end_inset

 will decay at least exponentially fast with 
\begin_inset Formula $|x|$
\end_inset

.
 To obtain such solutions, we need some mechanism to trap waves.
 Obviously, guided modes will not occur if 
\begin_inset Formula $c=\mbox{constant}$
\end_inset

 in an infinite domain 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{2}$
\end_inset

, since in that case 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{k}$
\end_inset

 will simply be a sinusoid [yielding planewave solutions 
\begin_inset Formula $u=e^{i(\vec{k}\cdot\vec{x}-\omega t)}$
\end_inset

].
 The simplest way to construct guided modes is to have 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hard walls
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 direction, such as a finite domain 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in[0,L]$
\end_inset

 with Dirichlet boundary conditions 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{k}(0)=u_{k}(L)=0$
\end_inset

, in which case 
\begin_inset Formula $c=\mbox{constant}$
\end_inset

 gives eigenfunctions 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{k}(x)=\sin(n\pi x/L)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $n=1,2,\ldots$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{n}(k)=c\sqrt{(n\pi/L)^{2}+k^{2}}$
\end_inset

.
 Physically, this corresponds to waves propagating within a

Intuitively, decreasing

 region 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pulls down
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 solutions from the light cone, and once a solution falls below the light
 cone it is necessarily guided.
 This can be proved mathematically in a couple of ways (aside from numerical
 demonstrations).
 First, this particular 2d problem happens to be simple enough to be solvable
 analytically: essentially, you write 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{k}$
\end_inset

 as a sine or cosine in the 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1}$
\end_inset

 region and as decaying exponentials in the 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{0}$
\end_inset

 regions, and then match the solutions at 
\begin_inset Formula $|x|=h/2$
\end_inset

 to enforce continuity of 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{k}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{k}'$
\end_inset

.
 After tedious algebra, this leads to a transcendental equation that you
 can analyze to find 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{\bot}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

.
 However, that approach, besides being somewhat messy, is quite limited
 to this specific 
\begin_inset Formula $c(x)$
\end_inset

 in two dimensions.
 Instead, in the next section we will derive the existence of guided modes
 
\emph on
without

 solving the PDE, but in a

 setting (that can even be extended to three dimensions).

\begin_layout Standard
We want to show that the fundamental (lowest-
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

) mode 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{1}(k)$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $<c_{0}|k|$
\end_inset

, and hence is guided (exponentially decaying in 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{0}$
\end_inset

).
 To do this, we don't actually need to 
\emph on
compute
\emph default
 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{1}$
\end_inset

, we only need to find an 
\emph on
upper bound
\emph default
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{1}$
\end_inset

 and show that this bound is 
\begin_inset Formula $<c_{0}|k|$
\end_inset

.
 The key to finding an upper bound is the 
\series bold
min--max theorem
\series default
, also known as the 
\series bold
variational theorem
\series default
: for any self-adjoint operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}_{k}$
\end_inset

 , it is easy to show
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 that the smallest eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{1}^{2}$
\end_inset

 minimizes the Rayleigh quotient 
\begin_inset Formula $R\{u\}=\langle u,\hat{A}_{k}u\rangle/\langle u,u\rangle$
\end_inset

 over all 
\begin_inset Formula $u(x)$
\end_inset

, and in particular that 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{1}^{2}\leq R\{u\}$
\end_inset

 for 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 
\begin_inset Formula $u(x)$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, we just need to find 
\emph on
some
\emph default
 
\begin_inset Formula $u(x)$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $R\{u\}<c_{0}^{2}k^{2}$
\end_inset

 and it will follow that 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{1}<c_{0}|k|$
\end_inset

: that a guided mode exists.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Multiplying both sides of 
\begin_inset Formula $R\{u\}<c_{0}^{2}k^{2}$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\langle u,u\rangle$
\end_inset

 and integrating the numerator 
\begin_inset Formula $\langle u,\hat{A}_{k}u\rangle$
\end_inset

 once by parts, we obtain 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left(|u'|^{2}+k^{2}|u|^{2}\right)dx<c_{0}^{2}k^{2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{|u|^{2}}{c^{2}}dx.
\]

\end_inset

Now, if we can find 
\emph on
some
\emph default
 function 
\begin_inset Formula $u(x)$
\end_inset

 for which this inequality is true, we are done.
 It turns out that there are many choices of 
\begin_inset Formula $u(x)$
\end_inset

 that will work, but one of the easiest is 
\begin_inset Formula $u(x)=e^{-|x|/L}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is a free parameter that we can choose to enforce the inequality.
 Before we do this, let us be more precise about 
\begin_inset Formula $c(x)$
\end_inset

.
 We could use this technique to analyze the specific piecewise-constant
 
\begin_inset Formula $c(x)$
\end_inset

 from the previous section, but it turns out that we can prove localization
 for a much wider range of 
\begin_inset Formula $c(x)$
\end_inset

 functions.
 In particular, we write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1}{c(x)^{2}}=\frac{1}{c_{0}^{2}}+\Delta(x),
\]

\end_inset

so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta(x)>0\Leftrightarrow c(x)<c_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 We will allow 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta(x)$
\end_inset

 to be 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 function as long as there is a localized 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

slow
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $c<c_{0}$
\end_inset

) region 
\emph on
on average
\emph default
, as defined by the following two conditions: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\Delta(x)\, dx>0\qquad\mbox{(slow on average)},
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|\Delta(x)|\, dx<\infty\qquad\mbox{(\ensuremath{c\neq c_{0}}is localized)}.
\]

\end_inset

We will now show that these two conditions are sufficient to imply that
 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{1}(k)<c_{0}|k|$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $k\neq0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Plugging this 
\begin_inset Formula $1/c^{2}$
\end_inset

 into our desired inequality on 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

, we immediately see that the 
\begin_inset Formula $k^{2}|u|^{2}$
\end_inset

 terms cancel on both sides.
 Computing the integral 
\begin_inset Formula $\int|u'|^{2}dx=\frac{2}{L^{2}}\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-2x/L}=\frac{1}{L}$
\end_inset

, we are left with: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1}{L}<c_{0}^{2}k^{2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\Delta(x)\, e^{-2|x|/L}dx.
\]

\end_inset

For any 
\begin_inset Formula $k\neq0$
\end_inset

, this is true for a sufficiently large choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

.
 To show this, it suffices to show that the inequality holds in the limit
 
\begin_inset Formula $L\to\infty$
\end_inset

.
 The limit of the left-hand side is 0, while the limit of the right hand
 side is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lim_{L\to\infty}c_{0}^{2}k^{2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\Delta(x)\, e^{-2|x|/L}dx=c_{0}^{2}k^{2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\Delta(x)\,\lim_{L\to\infty}e^{-2|x|/L}dx=c_{0}^{2}k^{2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\Delta(x)\, dx.
\]

\end_inset

Interchanging limits and integration is not allowed in general, but it is
 okay under various conditions on the integrand that one can look up in
 analysis textbooks.
 In this case, it is okay because of something called

In particular, you can interchange limits and integration for 
\begin_inset Formula $\int f(x)$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $|f(x)|\leq g(x)$
\end_inset

 for some 
\begin_inset Formula $g(x)$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\int g(x)<\infty$
\end_inset

.
 In this case 
\begin_inset Formula $|\Delta(x)\, e^{-2|x|/L}|\leq|\Delta(x)|$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\int|\Delta|<\infty$
\end_inset

 by our assumption of a localized slow region.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Thus, in the 
\begin_inset Formula $L\to\infty$
\end_inset

 limit, our inequality becomes
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
0<c_{0}^{2}k^{2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\Delta(x)\, dx,
\]

\end_inset

which is true for 
\begin_inset Formula $k\ne0$
\end_inset

 due to our assumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\int\Delta>0.$
\end_inset

 If the inequality holds for 
\begin_inset Formula $L\to\infty$
\end_inset

, then it must also hold for some sufficiently large (but finite) 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, there exists a 
\begin_inset Formula $u(x)$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{1}(k)^{2}\leq R\{u\}<c_{0}^{2}k^{2}$
\end_inset

 and hence we have at least one guided mode with a frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{1}$
\end_inset

 below the light cone.

 For the SchrÃ¶dinger operator 
\begin_inset Formula $-\nabla^{2}+V(\vec{x})$
\end_inset

, one similarly wants to show 
\begin_inset Formula $\int|\nabla u|^{2}<-\int|u|^{2}V$
\end_inset

 for some trial function 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 in order to prove that the eigenvalue is negative (hence localized if 
\begin_inset Formula $V\to0$
\end_inset

 for large 
\begin_inset Formula $|x|$
\end_inset

), so by comparison we see that 
\begin_inset Formula $-\Delta$

The fact that the proof in the previous section was so easy (at the level

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

), and would have worked for almost any reasonable choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $u(x)$
\end_inset

 where we have a parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 to control the localization length, is essentially the consequence of a
 scaling relationship.
 Slightly rewritten, we wanted to show 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\int|\nabla u|^{2}}{\int|u|^{2}}<c_{0}^{2}k^{2}\frac{\int|u|^{2}\Delta}{\int|u|^{2}}.
\]

\end_inset

Suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\ne0$
\end_inset

 only in some region of diameter 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $u=\psi(\vec{x}/L)$
\end_inset

 for some square-integrable function 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 (so that 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 controls the lengthscale as above).
 Then the left-hand side scales as 
\begin_inset Formula $1/L^{2}$
\end_inset

, while the right-hand side scales as 
\begin_inset Formula $h/L$
\end_inset

 (the fraction of 
\begin_inset Formula $|u|^{2}$
\end_inset

 in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\ne0$
\end_inset

 region).
 Therefore, it is obvious that the inequality must hold for a sufficiently
 large 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

.
 In general, the consequence is that 
\emph on
localization is easy in one dimension
\emph default
---even for an arbitrarily weak 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

potential well
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (small 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta$
\end_inset

 and/or small 
\begin_inset Formula $k^{2}$
\end_inset

), one always has a localized eigenfunction, a familiar theorem in quantum
 mechanics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In higher dimensions, however, the same scaling comparison tells us that
 matters are different.
 In 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 dimensions, the left-hand side still scales as 
\begin_inset Formula $1/L^{2}$
\end_inset

, but the right-hand side scales as 
\begin_inset Formula $(h/L)^{d}$
\end_inset

.
 This means that for 
\begin_inset Formula $d>2$
\end_inset

 it is 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 advantageous to have a large 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

, so weak localization does not occur.
 For dimensions 
\begin_inset Formula $>2$
\end_inset

, you must have a sufficiently strong 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

potential well
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in order to localize a solution, again a well-known fact in quantum mechanics
 but true in other areas as well.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $d=2$
\end_inset

, both sides of the inequality scale in the same way with 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

, which tells us that two dimensions is a borderline case that requires
 a more delicate analysis.

In fact, it turns out that an arbitrarily weak potential well 
\emph on
does
\emph default
 produce a localized eigenfunction in 2d wave equations, but the proof is
 quite tricky.
 The first proof, in 1976, involved extremely sophisticated functional analysis

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, but involved more complicated trial functions like 
\begin_inset Formula $u(\vec{x})\sim e^{-(|\vec{x}|+1)^{\alpha}}$
\end_inset

 in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\to0$
\end_inset

 limit, which are very tricky to integrate (in practice, one just bounds
 the integrals).
 The analogous problem for waveguides is a 3d waveguide in which the solutions
 are localized in two transverse dimensions (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Formula $xy$
\end_inset

), and again it turns out that there is indeed a guided mode for every 
\begin_inset Formula $k\neq0$
\end_inset

 wave equation and for complicated media
